This folder contains everything to compile and make work the fortran project.

The program call_module make use of the subroutines in function.f90 and solvSystem.f90

'make' will create executable files

'make plot' will create the plot for the original function

'make plot' will change the definition of the function on function.f90
      and recompile everything for 3 more functions making use of a bash script called differentFunctions.sh
'male plot_times' will use plot_times.sh to call the main program call_module2.f90 wich is a modified version of call_module.f90 that doesn't print the output
      instead it uses the routine cpu_time and the number of elements passed to the program.
      This scripts saves the relation N - execution time to a file and then plots it using gnuplot.

The plots are generated with gnuplot scrips plot.gnuplot and plot_times.gnuplot
